		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>This project is the result of a casual trip to the Azores in 2019, where I had the opportunity to explore and capture the unparalleled beauty of the island of São Miguel through the lens of my camera.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>About Me</h3>	
		<p>My name is Miguel. I am a photographer, videomaker, and graphic designer passionate about capturing unique moments, telling engaging stories, and creating impactful visual identities. Despite my few years of experience, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a creative approach that translates into high-quality work.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Professional Objectives</h3>
		<p>The goal of this project is to share the essence and magic of São Miguel, transporting the viewer to this natural paradise through carefully captured images. Each photograph aims not only to portray the island's natural beauty but also to convey the tranquility and authenticity that make it unique.</p>
